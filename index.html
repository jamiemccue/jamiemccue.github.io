  <h1>Jamie McCue, Product Designer, Comox Valley ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦</h1>

  <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Jamie McCue, a multidisciplinary designer and web builder connecting people with 
    digital products in meaningful ways through the process of design.</p>

  <p>I love to build things, Iâ€™m always tinkering with constant curiosity and 
    frequent experimentation. With over 10 years of building for the web, Iâ€™m 
    comfortable creating end-to-end experiences, defining marketing strategy, 
    product management, and collaborating with developers to solve challenging problems.

  <p>My skill set allows me to design and build software along with learn from the people 
    who use it. Itâ€™s gratifying taking concepts from ideation to implementation, 
    to guide engagement and a successful user experience. I value collaboration, 
    teamwork, empathy and leadership.</p>

  <h2>Always be learning.</h2>

  <p>I believe there is a science behind a good experience. It includes the 
    study of how people think and the psychology behind decision making. Through 
    qualitative and quantitive research methods, I learn about the needs of users 
    and take action to continuously improve their experience.</p>

  <p>Currently, Iâ€™m working with the cross-functional team at Bitovi.com, a digital 
    consultancy specializing in user experience design and javascript development. 
    I help our clients to optimize the user experience and usability of their 
    software and collaborate with teams to ship tools customers love.</p>

  <p>Previously, I was building the Propeller One app with a small team here in the 
    Comox Valley. Propeller One is an integrated aircraft journey log, technical 
    records and technical dispatch system for small airlines.</p>

  <p>Prior to Propeller One, I helped the team at Kitestrings launch a prototype 
    app to test for a business case. The app helps teams organize, centralize, 
    and share passwords for client projects.</p>

  <h3>Past Experience (2004 â€“ 2015)</h3>

  <p>Simplex Mobility, a mobility management services provider. Responsible for 
    designing and building a Ruby on Rails app called My-Serve with a small 
    distributed team. The purpose of My-Serve is to equip telecom admins with 
    helpful tools to manage their company wide mobility. Role included interaction 
    design, interface design, front-end development and product management. Making a 
    phone bill worth reading while saving businesses money.</p>

  <p>InQuicker responsible for UI designs which addressed business, brand and 
    patient requirements. I created user-flows, personas, wireframes, prototypes, 
    and coded HTML/CSS/SASS. Used detailed analysis and testing to develop ideas 
    and solutions to improve the patient experience. Collaborated with engineers 
    and marketing to ensure goals are met in the product development process.</p>

  <p>Prior to InQuicker I operated Architexture, a small web design studio founded 
    in 2004 providing a range of digital marketing and design services to clients 
    around North America. My specialities at Architexture included designing and 
    building custom WordPress themes, social media, email marketing, and website 
    performance optimization. I managed Google Analytics, Adwords and Webmaster 
    Tools for a roster of clients to provide insights and optimize marketing efforts. 
    In 2011 Architexture closed up shop to focus on software design.</p>

    music label releasing limited run, physical and digital formats with a family 
    of artists from around the world. (2007 â€“ Ongoing)</p>
